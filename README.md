# SleepDebtCalculatorJS
Another project from the front-end web development intensive from codeacademy!
This repo will have three versions (at least to begin with).
The first one, SleepDebtCalculator, follows step by step the algorithm given by the course. As I was writing that code I was compelled to write another version that was less repetitive.
That's where the SleepDebtCalculatorDRY version came from. As I was writing the second version, I saw it could be DRYed out even more, and also made a lot easier to modify in the future.
Hence, the third SleepDebtCalculatorDRYer was created.
I hope you enjoy seeing how the DRYness evolves from one version to another, and perhaps you'll be inspired to do a fourth SleepDebtCalculatorDYRest version?
